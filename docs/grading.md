You will submit your problem via editing this repository and pushing your code
to Github Classroom before the deadline. There may be an associated "quiz" where
you can submit answers as well.

Please ensure that this README is visibly accurate on GitHub after your final
submission.

This is a Markdown file which allows for easy writing of rich text.  Many
editors and IDEs will display a rendered version of this text for easy reading.
Please read more about [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for style and
syntax references.

###  Submissions
Some problems will require code, and some will be textual.  The latter will
be captured via quizes on canvas to facilitate grading.  All code will be
submitted through this repository.

In addition to the answers you provide, we will subjectively grade you on the
overall quality of your submission - stylistic consistency, readability, design,
documentation, commenting, appropriate commit history, etc.  Treat this
assignment as if it were a collaborative project in a real working environment.

For example, regarding git history, we do not want to see a single commit with
all of your work.  You should have an appropriate amount of history with
consistent and logically isolated commits, minimal 'undo' commits, no
unnecessary files added, etc.

Each problem set will be worth a total of 100 points.  What you see here is
for code only - the remaining points will be allocated to answers in Canvas
and overall assessment.
